# RSS Feeds by TabHub

Here's some RSS feeds created/collected by [TabHub](https://tabhub.github.io/). You can add them as TabHub card resources in your own manifest file:

* [Hacker News Daily Top 12](https://github.com/tabhub/rss-feeds/blob/main/data/hn-daily/latest.xml)
* [Perl Weekly](https://github.com/tabhub/rss-feeds/blob/main/data/perl-weekly/latest.xml)

or just directly use our [resource manifest](https://github.com/tabhub/rss-feeds/blob/main/manifest.json) that includes all above RSS feeds.
